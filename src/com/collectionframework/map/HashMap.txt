1️⃣ What is HashMap Internally?

Internally it looks like:
Node<K,V>[] table;

2️⃣ Internal Structure of Node

Simplified version:
static class Node<K,V> {
    final int hash;
    final K key;
    V value;
    Node<K,V> next;
}

So each bucket contains:     
hash
key
value
next (for linked list)


Java 8 Improvement
If bucket size becomes:

≥ 8 → Convert to Red-Black Tree
< 6 → Convert back to LinkedList

This improves performance from: O(n) → O(log n)
